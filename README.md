Commodities Database GLossary

- DACG (Direct Air Capture with Geothermal Heat): Captures CO₂ using geothermal heat to regenerate the capture solvents.
- DACC (Direct Air Capture with Conventional Heat): Captures CO₂ using conventional (typically fossil-based) heat sources.
- A (Amine-based Direct Air Capture): Uses amine-based chemical solvents to bind CO₂ directly from ambient air.
- MED (Multi-Effect Distillation): A thermal desalination process that uses multiple stages of evaporation and condensation to improve efficiency.
- MFD (Mechanical Vapor Compression Distillation): Desalination process that compresses vapor mechanically to recover and reuse heat.
- IO (Ion Osmosis or Inverse Osmosis): Membrane-based water purification or desalination technologies that rely on osmotic pressure.
- PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption): Separates nitrogen from air using pressure-driven adsorption and desorption cycles.
- AE (Alkaline Electrolysis): Produces hydrogen by electrolyzing water in an alkaline solution; a mature and widely used technology.
- PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis): Hydrogen production via electrolysis using a solid polymer membrane for high efficiency.
- HB (Haber-Bosch Process): Industrial synthesis of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen under high pressure and temperature.
- M (Methanation): Produces synthetic methane by reacting hydrogen with CO₂, typically via the Sabatier process.
